The layout is grid-based and modular, providing clear content separation and generous white space that enhances readability and visual hierarchy. Typography plays a central role, featuring bold, geometric sans-serif fonts with a clean and slightly technical feel, used in large uppercase headings and medium-weight body text. The neon yellow accent color is strategically applied to navigation backgrounds, call-to-action blocks, and highlighted sections, creating energetic focal points without overwhelming the design. UI components are minimal and functional, with simple black text and icons ensuring clarity and accessibility. Overall, the design conveys professionalism, modernity, and creative vibrancy, suitable for contemporary cultural institutions or brands seeking a bold yet clean visual identity.",

      "paletteUsageGuide": "Use the 'primary' color predominantly for text, icons, and key UI elements on light backgrounds to ensure maximum readability. The 'secondary' color serves as the main background, providing a clean and open canvas. The 'neonAccent' color is reserved for highlighting important interactive elements such as navigation bars, call-to-action blocks, and featured content backgrounds, always paired with 'primary' for text to maintain strong contrast. Avoid using 'neonAccent' for text to preserve legibility. The 'primaryForeground' and 'secondaryForeground' colors ensure text and icons stand out clearly against their respective backgrounds. This palette balances high contrast with vibrant energy, supporting accessibility and user engagement.",
      "paletteAccessibilityNotes": "The combination of 'primary' text on 'secondary' background meets WCAG AA and AAA contrast standards for normal and large text. The 'neonAccent' background with 'primary' text also meets WCAG AA contrast requirements, ensuring readability for call-to-action areas. Black text on white background and vice versa provide optimal contrast. Care should be taken to avoid using 'neonAccent' for small text or low contrast elements to maintain accessibility compliance."
