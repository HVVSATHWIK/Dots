# Roadmap Stubs Implemented

This file lists scaffolded modules representing future roadmap capabilities. Each exports minimal types/functions returning placeholder data so they can be progressively filled without breaking imports.

Covered Areas:
- Multimodal ingestion (ai/multimodal.ts)
- Taste vectors personalization (personalization/taste-vectors.ts)
- Portfolio provenance hashing (provenance/provenance.ts)
- Image & design moderation scaffold (moderation/image.ts)
- Price elasticity + fair price confidence (pricing/elasticity.ts, pricing/price-confidence.ts)
- Collaborative design threads (collaboration/design-threads.ts)
- Seasonal trend radar (trends/seasonal-radar.ts)
- Sustainability scoring (sustainability/index.ts)
- Repair triage flow (repair/triage.ts)
- Adaptive tone localization (localization/adaptive-tone.ts)
- Recommendation explainability (explainability/why-seen.ts)
- Personalization sliders (personalization/sliders.ts)
- Conversation compression (conversations/summary.ts)
- Offline ETL scaffold (etl/)
- Golden evaluation harness (eval/)
- Resilience test placeholder (tests/resilience.spec.ts)
- Edge cache abstraction (lib/edge-cache.ts)
- Risk heatmap (risk/heatmap.ts)
- Experiment assignment (experimentation/experiments.ts)
- Referrals / growth loop (growth/referrals.ts)
- Premium paywall guard (billing/premium-guard.ts)

Next Suggested Steps:
1. Decide ownership + maturation order (e.g., finalize experimentation + evaluation harness before complex models).
2. Add integration tests as soon as first real logic lands in each module.
3. Introduce shared error taxonomy & logging context across these modules.
4. Gradually replace stub hashes & pseudo random with cryptographic / model-backed outputs.
